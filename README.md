# Simple Rss Reader

This is a small project where we can read a RSS feed with a few requirements.
Need to see a list of feeds, view the most recent feeds, view feed items that are unread, and save items to a favorites list.

Could definetly be improved. Its a starting point and for an interview.

Ways to improve:
- Save to file (or better, connect to database)
- Optimize set manipulation
- etc
